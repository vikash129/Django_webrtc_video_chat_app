'''  
We need to create a routing configuration for the chat app that has a route to the consumer

We call the as_asgi() classmethod in order to get an ASGI application that will instantiate an instance of our consumer
 for each user-connection. This is similar to Djangoâ€™s as_view(), which plays the same role for per-request Django view instances.

(Note we use re_path() due to limitations in URLRouter.)
